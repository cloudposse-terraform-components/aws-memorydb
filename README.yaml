# Short description of this project
description: |-
  This component provisions an AWS MemoryDB cluster. MemoryDB is a fully managed, Redis-compatible, in-memory database
  service.

  While Redis is commonly used as a cache, MemoryDB is designed to also function well as a
  [vector database](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/memorydb/latest/devguide/vector-search.html). This makes it appropriate
  for AI model backends.

  ### Example

      vpc:
        vars:
          availability_zones:
            - "a"
            - "b"
            - "c"
          ipv4_primary_cidr_block: "10.111.0.0/18"
      memorydb:
        vars: {}
  ```
